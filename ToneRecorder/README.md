## ToneRecorder

In this experiment it is possible to play three buttons. Each has a different color LED and a sound with a different frequency emitted by a buzzer.
A fourth button, if pressed, starts the registration process. An LED remains lit as long as this session is active. It is possible to interrupt the session by pressing the third button again.
With recording enabled, the next 8 sounds (two beats) are stored. Automatically the LED related to the recording session turns off.
When the fourth button is pressed, the recorded notes are played, in parallel with the lighting of the relative LEDs.
In addition, a potentiometer allows you to play the sequence with three different speeds.

### Possible improvements
* Reset the registration
* Loop the recording
